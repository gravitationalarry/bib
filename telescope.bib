	Abstract = {We present a theoretical study of double compact objects as potential short/hard gamma-ray burst (GRB) progenitors. An updated population synthesis code, StarTrack, is used to calculate properties of double neutron stars and black hole-neutron star binaries. We obtain their formation rates, estimate merger times, and finally predict their most likely merger locations and afterglow properties for different types of host galaxies. Our results serve for a direct comparison with the recent HETE-2 and Swift observations of several short bursts, for which afterglows and host galaxies were detected. We also discuss the possible constraints these observations put on the evolutionary models of double compact object formation. We emphasize that our double compact object models can successfully reproduce at the same time short GRBs within both young, star-forming galaxies (e.g., GRB 050709 and GRB 051221A), as well as within old, elliptical hosts (e.g., GRB 050724 and probably GRB 050509B).},

@article{1367-2630-9-1-017,
	Abstract = {Recent months have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of short Î³-ray burst (SGRB) sources. There is now general agreement that SGRBs---or at least a substantial subset of them---are capable of producing directed outflows of relativistic matter with a kinetic luminosity exceeding by many millions that of active galactic nuclei. Given the twin requirements of energy and compactness, it is widely believed that SGRB activity is ultimately ascribable to a modest fraction of a solar mass of gas accreting on to a stellar mass black hole (BH) or to a precursor stage whose inevitable end point is a stellar mass BH. Astrophysical scenarios involving the violent birth of a rapidly rotating neutron star, or an accreting BH in a merging compact binary driven by gravitational wave emission are reviewed, along with other possible alternatives (collisions or collapse of compact objects). If a BH lies at the centre of this activity, then the fundamental pathways through which mass, angular momentum and energy can flow around and away from it play a key role in understanding how these prime movers can form collimated, relativistic outflows. Flow patterns near BHs accreting matter in the hypercritical regime, where photons are unable to provide cooling, but neutrinos do so efficiently, are discussed in detail, and we believe that they offer the best hope of understanding the central engine . On the other hand, statistical investigations of SGRB niches also furnish valuable information on their nature and evolutionary behaviour. The formation of particular kinds of progenitor sources appears to be correlated with environmental effects and cosmic epoch. In addition, there is now compelling evidence for the continuous fuelling of SGRB sources. We suggest here that the observed late flaring activity could be due to a secondary accretion episode induced by the delayed fall back of material dynamically stripped from a compact object during a merger or collision. Some important unresolved questions are identified, along with the types of observation that would discriminate among the various models. Many of the observed properties can be understood as resulting from outflows driven by hyperaccreting BHs and subsequently collimated into a pair of anti-parallel jets. It is likely that most of the radiation we receive is reprocessed by matter quite distant to the BH; SGRB jets, if powered by the hole itself, may therefore be one of the few observable consequences of how flows near nuclear density behave under the influence of strong gravitational fields.},

@article{Wandelt:2001p13439,
	Abstract = {We propose fast, exact and efficient algorithms for the convolution of two arbitrary functions on the sphere which speed up computations by a factor O(N) compared to present methods where N is the number of pixels. No simplifying assumptions are made other than band limitation. This reduces typical computation times for convolving the full sky with the asymmetric beam pattern of a megapixel cosmic microwave background (CMB) mission from months to minutes. Our methods enable realistic simulation and careful analysis of data from such missions, taking into account the effects of asymmetric ``point spread functions'' and far side lobes of the physical beam. While motivated by CMB studies, our methods are general and hence applicable to the convolution or filtering of any scalar field on the sphere with an arbitrary, asymmetric kernel. We show in an Appendix that the same ideas can be applied to the inverse problems of map-making and beam reconstruction by similarly accelerating the transpose convolution which is needed for the iterative solution of the normal equations.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational wave (GW) bursts (short duration signals) are expected to be associated with highly energetic astrophysical processes. With such high energies present, it is likely these astrophysical events will have signatures in the EM spectrum as well as in gravitational radiation. We have initiated a program, 'Locating and Observing Optical Counterparts to Unmodeled Pulses in Gravitational Waves' (LOOC UP) to promptly search for counterparts to GW burst candidates. The proposed method analyzes near real-time data from the LIGO--Virgo network, and then uses a telescope network to seek optical-transient counterparts to candidate GW signals. We carried out a pilot study using S5/VSR1 data from the LIGO--Virgo network to develop methods and software tools for such a search. We will present the method, with an emphasis on the potential for such a search to be carried out during the next science run of LIGO and Virgo, expected to begin in 2009.},

In contrast to previous work, where spin transforms are computed independently, our algorithm permits the computation of several distinct spin transforms simultaneously. Specifically, only one set of special functions is computed for transforms of quantities with any spin, namely the Wigner d matrices evaluated at Ï/2, which may be computed with efficient recursions. For any spin, the computation scales as {\cal O}(L^3), where L is the band limit of the function. Our publicly available numerical implementation permits very high accuracy at modest computational cost. We discuss applications to the cosmic microwave background and gravitational lensing.},

We study sidelobe pickup in three design concepts for the CALISTO infrared telescope. The beam convolution allows for direct comparison of the performance of each telescope design. At 100 microns, the best of these designs limits sidelobe contamination from Galactic dust emission to < 0.1 MJy/sr for most of the sky with |b| > 25 deg. With the fast convolution method, we illustrate the impact of asymmetric primary beams on the recovery of the temperature power spectrum for the Planck microwave background mission. Finally, we use the fast convolution method to specify a class of orientable filters on the sphere, working through a pedagogical example.},

@article{2041-8205-734-2-L35,
	Abstract = {Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are thought to be magnetars: neutron stars powered by extreme magnetic fields. These rare objects are characterized by repeated and sometimes spectacular gamma-ray bursts. The burst mechanism might involve crustal fractures and excitation of non-radial modes which would emit gravitational waves (GWs). We present the results of a search for GW bursts from six galactic magnetars that is sensitive to neutron star f -modes, thought to be the most efficient GW emitting oscillatory modes in compact stars. One of them, SGR 0501+4516, is likely ~1 kpc from Earth, an order of magnitude closer than magnetars targeted in previous GW searches. A second, AXP 1E 1547.0--5408, gave a burst with an estimated isotropic energy >10 44 erg which is comparable to the giant flares. We find no evidence of GWs associated with a sample of 1279 electromagnetic triggers from six magnetars occurring between 2006 November and 2009 June, in GW data from the LIGO, Virgo, and GEO600 detectors. Our lowest model-dependent GW emission energy upper limits for band- and time-limited white noise bursts in the detector sensitive band, and for f -mode ringdowns (at 1090 Hz), are 3.0 Ã 10 44 d 2 1 erg and 1.4 Ã 10 47 d 2 1 erg, respectively, where ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/734/2/L35/apjl390016ieqn1.gif] {$d_\mathrm{1} = \frac{d_{\mathrm{0501}}}{1\,\mathrm{kpc}}$} and d 0501 is the distance to SGR 0501+4516. These limits on GW emission from f -modes are an order of magnitude lower than any previous, and approach the range of electromagnetic energies seen in SGR giant flares for the first time.},

We present parameter-estimation simulations for inspirals of black-hole--neutron-star binaries using Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods. As a specific example of the power of these methods, we consider source localization in the sky and analyze the degeneracy in it when data from only two detectors are used. We focus on the effect that the black-hole spin has on the localization estimation. We also report on a comparative Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis with two different waveform families, at 1.5 and 3.5 post-Newtonian orders.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a general framework for studying the effectiveness of networks of interferometric gravitational wave detectors and then uses it to show that enlarging the existing LIGO--VIRGO network with one or more planned or proposed detectors in Japan (LCGT), Australia, and India brings major benefits, including much larger detection rate increase than previously thought. I focus on detecting bursts, i.e. short-duration signals, with optimal coherent data-analysis methods. I show that the polarization-averaged sensitivity of any network of identical detectors to any class of sources can be characterized by two numbers---the visibility distance of the expected source from a single detector and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a confident detection---and one angular function, the antenna pattern of the network. I show that there is a universal probability distribution function (PDF) for detected SNR values, which implies that the most likely SNR value of the first detected event will be 1.26 times the search threshold. For binary systems, I also derive the universal PDF for detected values of the orbital inclination, taking into account the Malmquist bias; this implies that the number of gamma-ray bursts associated with detected binary coalescences should be 3.4 times larger than expected from just the beaming fraction of the gamma burst. Using network antenna patterns, I propose three figures of merit (f.o.m.'s) that characterize the relative performance of different networks. These measure (a) the expected rate of detection by the network and any sub-networks of three or more separated detectors, taking into account the duty cycle of the interferometers, (b) the isotropy of the network antenna pattern, and (c) the accuracy of the network at localizing the positions of events on the sky. I compare various likely and possible networks, based on these f.o.m.'s. Adding any new site to the planned LIGO--VIRGO network can dramatically increase, by factors of 2--4, the detected event rate by allowing coherent data analysis to reduce the spurious instrumental coincident background. Moving one of the LIGO detectors to Australia additionally improves direction finding by a factor of 4 or more. Adding LCGT to the original LIGO--VIRGO network not only improves direction finding but will further increase the detection rate over the extra-site gain by factors of almost 2, partly by improving the network duty cycle. Including LCGT, LIGO-Australia, and a detector in India gives a network with position error ellipses a factor of 7 smaller in area and boosts the detected event rate a further 2.4 times above the extra-site gain over the original LIGO--VIRGO network. Enlarged advanced networks could look forward to detecting 300--400 neutron star binary coalescences per year.},

	Abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to SMBH binary mergers observed by LISA can be localized to within the field of view of astronomical instruments (~10 deg 2 ) hours to weeks prior to coalescence. The temporal coincidence of any prompt EM counterpart with a gravitationally timed merger may offer the best chance of identifying a unique host galaxy. We discuss the challenges posed by searches for such prompt EM counterparts and propose novel observational strategies to address them. In particular, we discuss the size and shape evolution of the LISA localization error ellipses on the sky and quantify the corresponding requirements for dedicated EM surveys of the area prior to coalescence. A triggered EM counterpart search campaign will require monitoring a several square degree area. It could aim for variability at the 24-27 mag level in optical bands, for example, which corresponds to 1%-10% of the Eddington luminosity of the prime LISA sources of ~10 6 -10 7 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} BHs at z = 1--2, on timescales of minutes to hours, the orbital timescale of the binary in the last 2-4 weeks of coalescence. A cross-correlation of the period of any variable EM signal with the quasi-periodic gravitational waveform over 10-1000 cycles may aid the detection. Alternatively, EM searches can detect a transient signal accompanying the coalescence. The triggered searches will be ambitious, but if they successfully identify a unique prompt EM counterpart, they will enable new fundamental tests of gravitational physics. We highlight the measurement of differences in the arrival times of photons and gravitons from the same cosmological source as a valuable independent test of the massive character of gravity and of possible violations of Lorentz invariance in the gravity sector.},

In order to undertake electromagnetic follow-ups of gravitational wave signals, it will be necessary to accurately localize them in the sky.

The expected timing accuracy for observed signals and the consequences for localization are investigated. In addition, the effect of systematic uncertainties in the waveform and calibration of the instruments on the localization of sources is discussed. Illustrative results of timing and localization accuracy as well as systematic effects for coalescing binary waveforms are provided.},

@article{iLIGO,
	Abstract = {The goal of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is to detect and study gravitational waves (GWs) of astrophysical origin. Direct detection of GWs holds the promise of testing general relativity in the strong-field regime, of providing a new probe of exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars and of uncovering unanticipated new astrophysics. LIGO, a joint Caltech--MIT project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning. They are now operating at their design sensitivity, and are sensitive to gravitational wave strains smaller than one part in 10 21 . With this unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place limits on GWs from a variety of potential astrophysical sources.},

In these four months the detector achieved a good duty cycle, larger than 80%, and an average horizon distance for binary neutron star system sources of about 4 Mpc. An intense commissioning activity was resumed after the run was complete to further increase the performances of the detector and to prepare the Virgo+ upgrades. The detector performances during the first science run and the last commissioning achievements are briefly discussed here.},

@article{aLIGO,
	Abstract = {The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are next generation instruments which will replace the existing initial LIGO detectors. They are currently being constructed and installed. Advanced LIGO strain sensitivity is designed to be about a factor 10 better than initial LIGO over a broad band and usable to 10 Hz, in contrast to 40 Hz for initial LIGO. This is expected to allow for detections and significant astrophysics in most categories of gravitational waves. To achieve this sensitivity, all hardware subsystems are being replaced with improvements. Designs and expected performance are presented for the seismic isolation, suspensions, optics and laser subsystems. Possible enhancements to Advanced LIGO, either to resolve problems that may arise and/or to allow for improved performance, are now being researched. Some of these enhancements are discussed along with some potential technology being considered for detectors beyond Advanced LIGO.},

	Abstract = {The final inspiral of double neutron star and neutron-star-black-hole binaries are likely to be detected by advanced networks of ground-based gravitational wave (GW) interferometers. Maximizing the science returns from such a discovery will require the identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. Here we critically evaluate and compare several possible counterparts, including short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), "orphan" optical and radio afterglows, and day-long optical transients powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei synthesized in the merger ejecta ("kilonovae"). We assess the promise of each counterpart in terms of four "Cardinal Virtues": detectability, high fraction, identifiability, and positional accuracy. Taking into account the search strategy for typical error regions of tens of square degrees, we conclude that SGRBs are the most useful to confirm the cosmic origin of a few GW events, and to test the association with neutron star mergers. However, for the more ambitious goal of localizing and obtaining redshifts for a large sample of GW events, kilonovae are instead preferred. Off-axis optical afterglows are detectable for at most tens of percent of events, while radio afterglows are promising only for energetic relativistic ejecta in a high-density medium. Our main recommendations are: (1) an all-sky gamma-ray satellite is essential for temporal coincidence detections, and for GW searches of gamma-ray-triggered events; (2) the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope should adopt a one-day cadence follow-up strategy, ideally with 0.5 hr per pointing to cover GW error regions; and (3) radio searches should focus on the relativistic case, which requires observations for a few months.},

	Abstract = {The data analysis problem of coherently searching for unmodeled gravitational-wave bursts in the data generated by a global network of gravitational-wave observatories has been at the center of research for almost two decades. As data from these detectors are starting to be analyzed, a renewed interest in this problem has been sparked. A Bayesian approach to the problem of coherently searching for gravitational wave bursts with a network of ground-based interferometers is presented here. We demonstrate how to systematically incorporate prior information on the burst signal and its source into the analysis. This information may range from the very minimal, such as best-guess durations, bandwidths or polarization content, to complete prior knowledge of the signal waveforms and the distribution of sources through spacetime. We show that this comprehensive Bayesian formulation contains several previously proposed detection statistics as special limiting cases, and demonstrate that it outperforms them.},

An associated library of computational algorithms and visualization software supports fast scientific applications executable directly on discretized spherical maps generated from very large volumes of astronomical data. Originally developed to address the data processing and analysis needs of the present generation of cosmic microwave background experiments (e.g., BOOMERANG, WMAP ), HEALPix can be expanded to meet many of the profound challenges that will arise in confrontation with the observational output of future missions and experiments, including, e.g., Planck , Herschel , SAFIR , and the Beyond Einstein inflation probe. In this paper we consider the requirements and implementation constraints on a framework that simultaneously enables an efficient discretization with associated hierarchical indexation and fast analysis/synthesis of functions defined on the sphere. We demonstrate how these are explicitly satisfied by HEALPix.},

	Abstract = {The inspirals and mergers of compact binaries are among the most promising events for ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories. The detection of electromagnetic (EM) signals from these sources would provide complementary information to the GW signal. It is therefore important to determine the ability of GW detectors to localize compact binaries on the sky, so that they can be matched to their EM counterparts. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to study sky localization using networks of ground-based interferometers. Using a coherent-network analysis, we find that the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo network can localize 50% of their detected neutron star binaries to better than 50 deg 2 with a 95% confidence interval. The addition of the Large Scale Cryogenic Gravitational Wave Telescope (LCGT) and LIGO-Australia improves this to 12 deg 2 . Using a more conservative coincident detection threshold, we find that 50% of detected neutron star binaries are localized to 13 deg 2 using the LIGO-Virgo network, and to 3 deg 2 using the LIGO-Virgo-LCGT-LIGO-Australia network. Our findings suggest that the coordination of GW observatories and EM facilities offers great promise.},

@article{Nissanke:2010,
	Abstract = {Recent observations support the hypothesis that a large fraction of "short-hard" gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) are associated with the inspiral and merger of compact binaries. Since gravitational-wave (GW) measurements of well-localized inspiraling binaries can measure absolute source distances, simultaneous observation of a binary's GWs and SHB would allow us to directly and independently determine both the binary's luminosity distance and its redshift. Such a "standard siren" (the GW analog of a standard candle) would provide an excellent probe of the nearby ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.3) universe's expansion, independent of the cosmological distance ladder, thereby complementing other standard candles. Previous work explored this idea using a simplified formalism to study measurement by advanced GW detector networks, incorporating a high signal-to-noise ratio limit to describe the probability distribution for measured parameters. In this paper, we eliminate this simplification, constructing distributions with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. We assume that each SHB observation gives source sky position and time of coalescence, and we take non-spinning binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star coalescences as plausible SHB progenitors. We examine how well parameters (particularly distance) can be measured from GW observations of SHBs by a range of ground-based detector networks. We find that earlier estimates overstate how well distances can be measured, even at fairly large signal-to-noise ratio. The fundamental limitation to determining distance proves to be a degeneracy between distance and source inclination. Overcoming this limitation requires that we either break this degeneracy, or measure enough sources to broadly sample the inclination distribution.},
